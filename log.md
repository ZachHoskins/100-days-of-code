### Day 1: May 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. I also went through the first 2 JavaScript Challenges in Exercism.

**Thoughts** The HTML was a good review of concepts that I have learned in the past. I joined the JavaScript Mentor Mode in Exercism, and my submitted answers have to be reviewed by a mentor before moving onto the next challenge. The first two challenges were simple, but I'm looking forward to getting harder challenges as the days go on.

### Day 2: May 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp. I also went through 2 JavaScript Challenges on Exercism.

**Thoughts**: The CSS was a good refresher, and I learned more about creating variables in CSS. The JavaScript challenges are getting more challenging, and the second one today made me think to come up with a solution for it. Currently waiting for my solution for the resistor-code-duo to be reviewed to see if I can improve upon my solution in any way.
