### Day 1: May 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. I also went through the first 2 JavaScript Challenges in Exercism.

**Thoughts** The HTML was a good review of concepts that I have learned in the past. I joined the JavaScript Mentor Mode in Exercism, and my submitted answers have to be reviewed by a mentor before moving onto the next challenge. The first two challenges were simple, but I'm looking forward to getting harder challenges as the days go on.

### Day 2: May 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp. I also went through 2 JavaScript Challenges on Exercism.

**Thoughts**: The CSS was a good refresher, and I learned more about creating variables in CSS. The JavaScript challenges are getting more challenging, and the second one today made me think to come up with a solution for it. Currently waiting for my solution for the resistor-code-duo to be reviewed to see if I can improve upon my solution in any way.

### Day 3: May 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I went through 50% of Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I learned about different ways to position content using CSS, and it is helping me see how people use these methods to create CSS art and animations. I'm excited to continue learning more about CSS stylings and what I can do with them.

### Day 4: May 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I finished Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp. I got stuck on the next coding challenge on Exercism.

**Thoughts**: On FreeCodeCamp, I learned about using @keyframes to create animations in CSS. I am excited to start making animations, and may try to create an animated loading screen tomorrow. On Exercism I almost completed the challenge, but the testing suite keeps failing as I keep calculating the wrong UTC date. Taking a break from this challenge for a bit. I'll come back to it tomorrow and see if I can't figure it out then.
