### Day 1: May 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. I also went through the first 2 JavaScript Challenges in Exercism.

**Thoughts** The HTML was a good review of concepts that I have learned in the past. I joined the JavaScript Mentor Mode in Exercism, and my submitted answers have to be reviewed by a mentor before moving onto the next challenge. The first two challenges were simple, but I'm looking forward to getting harder challenges as the days go on.

### Day 2: May 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed Basic CSS on FreeCodeCamp. I also went through 2 JavaScript Challenges on Exercism.

**Thoughts**: The CSS was a good refresher, and I learned more about creating variables in CSS. The JavaScript challenges are getting more challenging, and the second one today made me think to come up with a solution for it. Currently waiting for my solution for the resistor-code-duo to be reviewed to see if I can improve upon my solution in any way.

### Day 3: May 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I went through 50% of Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I learned about different ways to position content using CSS, and it is helping me see how people use these methods to create CSS art and animations. I'm excited to continue learning more about CSS stylings and what I can do with them.

### Day 4: May 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I finished Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp. I got stuck on the next coding challenge on Exercism.

**Thoughts**: On FreeCodeCamp, I learned about using @keyframes to create animations in CSS. I am excited to start making animations, and may try to create an animated loading screen tomorrow. On Exercism I almost completed the challenge, but the testing suite keeps failing as I keep calculating the wrong UTC date. Taking a break from this challenge for a bit. I'll come back to it tomorrow and see if I can't figure it out then.

### Day 5: May 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out what I was doing wrong on the Gigasecond Exercism challenge. Also went through a couple lessons on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I was using the setSeconds() function in the Gigasecond challenge, and the time that I was calculating was an hour off. I needed to use the setUTCSeconds() function so that the time was in the same format and calculated the time correctly.

### Day 6: May 31, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Just went through the rest of Applied Accessibilty in freeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts**: I learned more about different ways I can make frontends more accessible. This includes using specific html tags for screen readers, using a good amount of contrast when selecting colors, and designing the flow of content intentionally so that it makes sense if someone cannot look at the screen to see the visual layout of elements.

### Day 7: June 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about flexbox on freeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy using flexbox. It seems to make displaying content very straightforward, and helps ensure content will look good on every device. I'm excited to go through the CSS Grid tomorrow, and get into Reponsive Projects later on in the week.

### Day 8: June 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about CSS Grid on freeCodeCamp. I also started the Tribute Page project on freeCodeCamp, and I'm making my tribute page on Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed CSS Grid, and I am definitely going to start using CSS Grid and flexbox more in projects that I do. I also started making a tribute page for Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and I look forward to finishing that up tomorrow. I will link to the finished tribute page once it is live on CodePen.

### Day 9: June 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished my Dietrich Bonhoeffer Tribute Page, and published it on codepen.

**Thoughts**: I think this is a very simple example using HTML and CSS, but I'm glad that I was able to combine the things that I've learned over this past week to make a real project. I definitely think there's more that could be done with it to make it look nicer, and function better. However, for now, it served its purpose.

### Day 10: June 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished up the survey form project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I am definitely happier with how this one turned out compared to the last project. I practiced making differnet form fields and making sure multiple choice answers were grouped together. This survey is a work from home survey to get a better understanding of how Covid-19 has impacted working from home for employees.

### Day 11: June 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the product landing page project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I am making the product landing page about a ergonomic split mechanical keyboard. I have the main layout of the site setup, and I need to add more content, and finish the styling.

### Day 12: June 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the product landing page from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I am enjoying making this landing page, and it is helping me with my understanding of CSS. It is forcing me to go through all of the CSS rules to get the page to render the way I want it to look. I decided to use the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard as my prodcut for this project.

### Day 13: June 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the product landing page from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I am learning a lot from this landing page project. I did not anticipate it taking this long, but it's true that you learn much more by actually building a real project versus just reading about concepts. I feel that I am learning much more in these past couple days that I have the entire time I've been learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Day 14: June 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the Product Landing Page project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: There was a lot that I learned about CSS though doing this project. This landing page was completely in HTML and CSS, and I got to use flexbox as well to help style things. I also learned how to make animations/transitions smoothly go back to the original state so that animations on buttons or links doesn't look choppy. I am happy with the way it turned out, and I look forward to continue making projects as I learned so much in this process.

### Day 15: June 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Technical Documentation project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I got the skeleton of the HTML written and it just needs to be filled with content.

### Day 16: June 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on the Technical Documentation project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I used the content from css-tricks.com to fill out the content on my Technical Documentation project. I am focused more on the code and making sure I am desiging a good front-end, and so I figured I would just copy the content from css-tricks to save time in creating all the content. Now I just need to finish the CSS to format the page.
