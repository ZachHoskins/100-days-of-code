### Day 1: May 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp. I also went throught the first 2 JavaScript Challenges in Exercism.

**Thoughts** The HTML was a good review of concepts that I have learned in the past. I joined the JavaScript Mentor Mode in Exercism, and my submitted answers have to be reviewed by a mentor before moving onto the next challenge. The first two challenges were simple, but I'm looking forward to getting harder challenges as the days go on.
